# Shadow Comments

**Leave private notes on your code without modifying the source file.**

Shadow Comments allows you to annotate code with "sticky notes" that only *you* can see. 
- Great for reading complex open-source code.
- Great for marking TODOs you don't want to commit to Git.
- Your annotations **do not** touch the actual file. 

## Features
- **Private Annotations:** Add comments that exist only in your VS Code editor.
- **Toggle Visibility:** Hide all comments with one click to see clean code.
- **Persistent:** Comments stick around even after you restart VS Code.

## Usage
1. Click on any line of code.
2. Press `Ctrl + Alt + C` (Mac: `Cmd + Alt + C`).
3. Type your note.
4. Press Enter.
